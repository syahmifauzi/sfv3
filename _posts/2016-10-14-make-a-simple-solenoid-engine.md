**Assalamualaikum and Hyep..** What's up guys? Today I want to share with you my _ICT Multimedia Project_. I made this project when I was in secondary school and presented using _Microsoft Movie Maker_. I call it Simple Solenoid Engine. I choose this topic because _I think anyone can be an Engineer_ and I have lots of paperclips on that time -.-'. At first, it is tough to make, but I did it after lots of failures and I realize that it is very easy to make and of course it is fun. Actually, this project was inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop6JlOY1H0) and [many more](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=solenoid+engine). It's awesome, but no tutorial on how to make it on that time, so I made one. Not so perfect, smallest and cool like the previous video but I hope it helps. Let's begin..


## What is Solenoid Engine?
- Solenoid is a loop of coil wire that’s goes around like a cylinder and produce electromagnetic field when carrying electric current. It will acts as a temporary magnet (not permanent magnet). Explained in the image below.

> Blue arrow = direction of magnetic field (North to South)    
> Red arrow, I = current flow through a conductor

- Electromagnetic field is produced when electricity flows through a conductor
- Engine is a machine with moving parts that converts power into motion (kinetic/mechanical energy)
- Solenoid Engine uses coil wire in place of the cylinder. It will produce strong electromagnetic field inside the cylinder and pulls the small magnet (act as a piston) into the cylinder.


## What We Need to Make a Simple Solenoid Engine?
1. Tools
- Glue gun & Hot glue stick
- Scissor
- Ruler
- Needle-Nose Plier
- Pen/pencil/anything to mark
2. Materials
- Small paper clips (No. 0025)
- Large paper clips (PC 050)
- Copper wire
- Laminating sheet/big straw/hard thin plastic
- Small round neodymium magnet
- (6v battery) OR (4x1.5v battery + battery holder)
- Strong glue
- Hollow board sheet
- Sandpaper

## How does it works?
Before we make it, let's understand how our solenoid engine works so that we can think some ideas to make it better (e.g. switch on/off design).

This is how our final product looks like..

Okay, this is how it works..   

1. When the small round magnet (piston) at the bottom, the circuit is close (switch on), current flows and the solenoid will produce electromagnetic field inside and outside the cylinder.
2. The small round magnet (piston) will attract to the electromagnet (it will go up).
3. When the magnet goes up, the circuit will open (switch off). The solenoid lose its electromagnet because no current flow and the piston will fall down due to the attraction of the gravity.
4. It will repeat (1, 2 & 3) continuously when connected to the power supply (eg. dry cell). Movement of piston (kinetic energy) will produce rotation (mechanical energy).


## What Factors that affect the (strength of the magnetic field), s?
![Factors](/assets/img/blogposts/sse-factors.jpg)

1. Number of turns (of wire). **↑turns, ↑s**
2. **Soft iron core** placed into the solenoid will **increase s**
3. Magnitude of the current flows. **↑current, ↑s**
4. Diameter of the wire. **↑Diameter, ↑s**


## So, Let's Make It
Sorry if it is too fast and just ignore the "I <3 PaperClips" part.. Haha.. I hope you can follow this tutorial.. ;)
